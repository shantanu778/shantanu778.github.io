I am working as "Assegnista di ricerca"- AKA (Research Assistant) at the the [University of Trento](https://webapps.unitn.it/du/it/Persona/PER0253874). Before joining here, I completed my masters in [Language and Communication Technologies](https://lct-master.org) which is Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Degree. I spent my 1st year of Masters at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands where I compeleted [Research Masters in Linguistics](https://www.rug.nl/masters/linguistics-research/?lang=en). In 2nd year of my masters, I enrolled in [Masters of Science in Cognitive Science](https://corsi.unitn.it/en/cognitive-science) at the University of Trento, Italy. This was my first experience living outside my country. I had the opportunity to engage with diverse cultures, collaborate with students from various backgrounds, and learn the value of inclusion and adaptability. Before my masters, I completed BSc in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Chittagong](https://web.cu.ac.bd/v2/) in my home country, which is Bangladesh. 

My academic journey has been transformative, and it has broadened my perspective and inspired me to continue learning and collaborating with different people. Throught my expereinces, I found my major interest in Natural Langauge Processing. I am also highly interested in Multimodal Learning especially focusing on Healthcare informatics.
