In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various NLP tasks. Despite their success, their internal processing remain an open question. Their complex architectures make interpretation challenging. Similarly, the human brain is a highly sophisticated computational system for processing language, and neuroscientist have long sought to understand its underlying mechanisms. Studies suggest that linguistic information is localized to specific brain regions. This raises a fundamental question: Do language models represent language in a way similar to the human brain? 

In this study, we examine how removing different linguistic properties affects the alignment between language models and brain responses. To achieve this, we first create multiple version of our corpus by removing syntactic or semantic information. For example, we replace all the nouns with a tag "NNOUN", transforming "Mary was a beautiful woman" into "NNOUN was a beautiful NNOUN". We then train two different language models LSTM and GPT2-small on the different distorted corpus where syntax or semantic information are replaced by corresponding tags. After that, we extract language representation of spoken narrative stories that contain fMRI responses while participants are listening to these stories. Then, we calculate the alignment by learning an encoding model to map two representations. Finally, we compare the alignments before and after removing the linguistic information.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
``` 


{% endraw %} -->
