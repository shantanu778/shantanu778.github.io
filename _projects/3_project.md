In this paper, the effects of pre-training of deep learning models are investigated. A computer vision
task on the identification of leaf diseases on Casava plants is performed with a pre-trained ResNet-34
model, as well as with a ResNet-34 model using randomized weights. Additionally, a natural language
processing task is done with sentiment analysis on Coronavirus related tweets. The sentiment analysis
is done using a pre-trained BERT model and an untrained version of BERT. In addition to the deep
learning approaches, two baseline models are developed as a reference for performance. As the
baseline model, a simple CNN is used for the computer vision task and an LSTM model is used for
the natural language processing task. The experiments clearly showed the importance of pre-training,
with the pre-trained ResNet-34 model yielding 85.7% accuracy over the untrained 76.7%, and the
pre-trained BERT model yielding 86.0% accuracy over the untrained 25.0%.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above: -->

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
